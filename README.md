# UIFaces.NET
A .NET Standard Library for using the UI Faces API.

## Usage
The main class is [`UIFacesService`](https://github.com/amweiss/dark-sky-core/blob/master/src/DarkSkyCore/Services/DarkSkyService.cs). When using it you will need provide your API key [here](https://uifaces.co/api-docs).

Once you have an instance of the class, use `GetFaces` to use the API which will return a List of [`Person`](https://github.com/amweiss/dark-sky-core/blob/master/src/DarkSkyCore/Services/DarkSkyService.cs)
